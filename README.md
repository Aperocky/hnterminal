# hnterminal

`pip install hnterminal`

HN browser in terminal.

Built on top of [HN API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) and [replbuilder](https://github.com/Aperocky/replbuilder)

TODO: Add login, reply and other `write` level activities

## Installation

`pip install hnterminal`

If your `PATH` include pip installation, `$ hnterminal` should invoke the terminal command from shell.

You may also run `python src/cli.py` off current repository.

## Usage

Getting current front page information for any HN front page categories (`-n` default to 30, but here at 5):

![front page](images/get_front_page.jpg)

Navigate using `POINTER` stored over previous command, `get_comments`, `get_user`, `get_story` all accept pointers:

![comment pointer](images/get_comments.jpg)

This terminal tool is *responsive!* Adjust to terminal width if you use a larger display, or move your terminal to a different display. Each command would adjust at call time, no need to quit browsing.

![responsive browsing](images/responsive_term.jpg)

`get_comments` use DFS to create a comment tree, you can control the parameter to set depth level, breadth, and limit for loading comments.

Additionally, `-1` pointer is reserved for parent of comments, so you can trace a comment all the way up:

![parent trace](images/parent_trace.jpg)

parent trace is helpful since you can see user comments via `get_user`

`get_user get_comments get_story` also support manual input (in addition to pointers), you can also utilize `get_link` on any previous commands to get the link to browser:

![aperocky](images/aperocky.jpg)

All story, comments you see are stored in the cache, for instant retrieval. However, each `get_front_page` call would invoke a call to front page to get the most recent list and order.

![cache](images/cache.jpg)

Help and direction is readily available for every command as this package depends on [replbuilder](https://github.com/Aperocky/replbuilder):
